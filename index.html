	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p> I am a problem solving addict, fueled by my passion for learning and self improvement. I take all problems as a personal challenge and conquer them swiftly and effectively. I lead with respect and appreciation for my coworkers allowing me to interact with them in an approachable and welcoming way.
	</p>
	<p>After getting a taste of the development process at a previous job, I enrolled in General Assembly's first online Web Development Immersive program to start my journey as a Web Developer. A surprising outcome to starting this program is that I discovered the core reason why I was drawn to the profession of Web Development: I loved to solve problems and build something useful.
	As we dived into languages like Angular, Node and MongoDB, I also strengthened my communication skills, learning to ask better questions and approach problems from different angles.
	The greatest skill I have learned from this program is the ability to utilize all of the resources available. These skills have empowered me to take action confidently and strategically when I am presented with a new challenge.</p>

	<p>The TumTum tracker was inspired by the outcomes tracker that students currently use while enrolled in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive Program. This was a collaborative MEAN stack project with another member of my class. The LinkedIn API and Github Jobs API was utilized to streamline the functionality of this app.</p>

	<a href="https://fullstack-force-wiki.herokuapp.com/"><i class="fa fa-external-link-square" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
	<p>After having several years experience using a company wiki, I jumped at the opportunity to build my own when the choice was presented to me. One of the flaws to the company wiki I used in the past was how primitive it looked. I wanted to build a wiki that maintained a simple platform layout but actually looked professional and beautiful. A wiki that I would like to use!
This project was primarily built with Node, Express and MongoDB and really exercised what I learned in class and tested my understanding of using bcrypt and mongoose schemas to store the information appropriately. One area of this project I would like to improve upon is the text input box being used. I am going to implement the "Marked" node package to give the user some formatting capabilities and I also want to setup a system to vote and approve articles that are posted.</p>

	<p>MakeupAlley is one of the oldest makeup review sites on the internet! As an avid lurker on this page, I was inspired to make my rendition of the site. My site is built with Ruby on Rails and utilizes Bootstrap-sass to style. Devise was used for user creation and management, and raty was used to provide a visual rating system.</p>
